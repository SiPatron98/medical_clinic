# Medical Clinic (In progress)
This will be a webapp built in Spring Boot framework. Patient can make an appointment or cancel future appointments. Doctor can see history of patient's diseases and add a note to completed appointment. To complete this project I need to add some DataJpaTests, SpringBootTests and consume some REST API.

To use this application you must authenticate yourself. To see patient's capabilities you can use this data:

login: zygmunt_pacjent

password: test

To see doctor's capabilities you can use this data:

To see admin's capabilities you can use this data:
